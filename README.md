Learning Github

Greetings World,

I am learning how to use github so that I can share and learn with others and become a better programmer.  I have a bachelor's in mathematics and have been working on my programming skills and some projects that I would like to share.  I am hoping to break into the data analysis/science world soon.  

Thank you ,
John Griffiths
